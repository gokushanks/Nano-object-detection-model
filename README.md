# Nano-object-detection-model
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the Ultralytics YOLOv8  deep learning model. It takes an input image, detects multiple objects (people, vehicles, traffic lights, etc.), and saves an annotated output image with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
